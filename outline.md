* Misunderstood or outdated best practices
  * GOF Design Patterns
    Still a relevent text from an academic perspective, but
    many of the patterns therein have either become outdated
    by the advent of more advanced tools (like refactoring IDEs)
    or are no longer relevent given modern frameworks

    Worse, many of the design patterns are taken as gospel and
    are implemented without understanding underlying tradeoffs

    Examples include:
      - Singleton pattern (Now widely considered an anti pattern)
      - Factory or Abstract Factory (with only one implementation)
